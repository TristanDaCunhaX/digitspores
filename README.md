## Info

This script generates a wide array of unique geometric digital entities, the Digitspores. They float, they flip, they swing, in a perfect harmonic dance which is both matemathical and natural. One may wonder if they're some new form of existence which can arise once we overcome the distinction between technology and biology.

## Traits

Each Digitspore is created unique. With multiple random extractions, each of the 9 main traits for shape and animation is set differently for each entity. Each trait has several tiers of frequency (3-5) which make the rarest Digitspores extremely precious yet easy to spot. The script then uses trigonometric functions to make shapes and animations resemble those of natural creatures.

### Rarity tiers:
- (R) rare ≈1%
- (U) uncommon ≈24%
- (C) common

### Swing:
- somersault (R)
- strong oscillation (U)
- weak oscillation (C)

### Head & Tail spin:
- fast (R)
- medium (U)
- slow (C)

### Tonnage
- xs (R)
- sm (U)
- md (C)
- lg (U)
- xl (R)

### Length
- xs (R)
- sm (U)
- md (C)
- lg (U)
- xl (R)

### Body shape
- none (R)
- pyramid (U)
- cube (C)
- fuse (U)
- double fuse (R)

### Limbs
- 2 (R)
- 4 (C)
- 8 (U)

### Tentacle shape
- leaf (R)
- arc (U)
- line (C)

### Palettes
- abyss (≈25%)
- blaze (≈25%)
- celestial (≈25%)
- dawn (≈25%)
