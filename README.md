# Digitspores
September 2021

by Tristan Da Cunha

## Info

This script generates a wide array of unique geometric digital entities, the Digitspores. They float, they flip, they swing, in a perfect harmonic dance which is both mathemathical and natural. One may wonder if they're some new form of existence which can arise once we overcome the distinction between technology and biology.

## Digitspores as NFTs
